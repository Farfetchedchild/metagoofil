What is this?
-------------

Metagoofil is a tool for extracting metadata of public documents (pdf,doc,xls,ppt,etc) availables in the target websites.This information could be useful because you can get valid usernames, or people names, for using later in bruteforce password attacks (vpn, ftp, webapps), the tool will also extracts interesting "paths" of the documents, where we can get shared resources names, server names, etc.


All this information should not be available on the net, but most of the companies doesn't have policies about information leaking... and most of them don't know this information exists.

How it works?
------------

The tool first queries google for different filetypes that can have useful metadata (pdf, doc, xls,ppt,etc),
then it download those documents to the disk and extracts the metadata of the file.


Dependencies:
------------

In this version all depencies are includedi (Hachoir Metadata and PdfMiner), if you are running Metagoofil in a Linux environment, you 
can take advantages from the "extract" program, so you need to install it in order to work.

Debian:
In debian is easy as: apt-get install libextractor

OS X:
Using Darwin ports, "port install libextractor"

Windows: http://gnunet.org/libextractor/download/win/libextractor-0.5.14.zip

Make sure 'extract' binary is on your path, if not you can modify extcommand variable inside program to suite your needs.


Shouts goes to: Javi, Vicente, and all Metagoofil users :)

Special thanks to Hachoir, PdfMiner and Markup projects
